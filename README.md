# ArduinoGarageDoor

This repo contains information about a project smartify my garage door opener.

Specifically, the goal was to create a UX around closing the garage door pre-commute
without having to run out the door to avoid getting hit.  This was accomplished
by routing the orginal button through an Arduino, detecting long-presses, and 
delaying the door-close for a period of time.

## Materials
* Ardino Uno
* Seedstudio Relay Shield
* Breadboard, cables, etc
* Genie Garage Door opener

## Thanks
Thanks to wife and family for enduring many open and closes while I worked out bugs ;)
