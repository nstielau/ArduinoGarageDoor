# ArduinoGarageDoor

This repo contains information about a project smartify my garage door opener.

Specifically, the goal was to create a UX around closing the garage door pre-commute
without having to run out the door to avoid getting hit.  This was accomplished
by routing the original button through an Arduino-controlled relay, detecting
long-presses, and delaying the door-close for a period of time.
